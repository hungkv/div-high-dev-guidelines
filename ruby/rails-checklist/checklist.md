## Rails checklist
### Readable and following standards
- [ ] Commit message contains ticket ID
- [ ] Namming: variable/methods/class
### Minimal and working solution
- [ ] Efficient
  - [ ] Checked N+1 queries 
  - [ ] Checked missing index
- [ ] To prove it's working the unit tests, integration tests should be updated
  - [ ] Code coverage is 80% or above
### Logging
- [ ] Errors are sent to log
### Another things
- [ ]  No hardcoding credentials
- [ ] No duplicate code present
- [ ] Code has been aggressively DRYed during development
- [ ] All tests pass before code is merged into a shared repository
- [ ] Have tests for email functions
- [ ] Do not use AWS and other 3rd services credentials for unit tests

- [ ] Set default values for database columns if needed
- [ ] Use Settings or constant for static value
- [ ] Use FactoryGirl for mocking data
- [ ] Unless JavaScript frontend needs to read cookies generated by the Rails server, set all cookies as httponly [Securing Rails Applications - Sessions] (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#sessions)
- [ ] Encoding: utf-8 everywhere
- [ ] Migration won't break (not null without default, too big table to update, rollback step work correctly)
